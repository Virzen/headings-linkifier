# headings-linkifier
Makes all headings on a page linkable, so you can save your position on the page for later use (or sharing with someone who has this script installed too).

This is a user script, which requires [Grease Monkey](firefox-addon)* to run.

## Installation
You can install user script automatically by viewing the script file on GitHub and clicking 'Raw' link. If you have Grease Monkey* addon installed, it will automatically recognize the file as a user script and prompt you with installation dialog.

For more details please refer to the [article on user script installation](gm-install-docs) on official wiki.
